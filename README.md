# Picture File Compare Tool
Script that compares two folders (jpeg & Raw) and if the jpeg is missing then it moves the raw file to a different folder

-
**What the program does:**

I made this because when I use my DSLR I like to shoot RAW + JPG. So that means I end up having one folder with two files with the same name (besides their file extension).
This program sorts the RAW into one folder, JPG into another folder and MOV into another (folders are created if they don’t exist).
After that you can go though and remove all the JPG files that you don’t want. 
Now if you run the program again it will move all the RAW files that don’t have a matching JPG anymore to a subfolder inside the RAW file. You can manually remove this or save it as needed.

**TO RUN:**

_(Make sure to have all files backed up! Just in case)_

1. Go into the "Releases" folder and copy the whole folder for the latest version.

2. In the "Pic File Compare Tool vX.X" folder RUN the .BAT file: "Run Pic File Compare Tool.bat", its used to start the .jar file: "PictureFileCompare-vX.X.jar"

3. Drag and Drop the folder you want to sort on the console window OR input the file path of the directory, then hit Enter.

4. The File should sort and a Log.txt file will be made in the directory picked.
